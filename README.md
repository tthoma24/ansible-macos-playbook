- Modifies MacOS settings (Role `settings`)
- Changes the user shell, if configured (Role `shell`)

## Installation

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) or [MacPorts](https://macports.org).
1. Install Python (`brew install python`) or (`sudo port install python`)
1. Install Ansible (`pip3 install ansible`) or (`sudo port install ansible`)
1. Copy `default.config.yml` to `config.yml` and edit the configuration to your likings.
   - **Don't skip this, otherwise your computer will be provisioned like mine :)**
1. Run `ansible-playbook main.yml`. Enter your account password when prompted.
   - If you have a configuration stored elsewhere (e.g. in a dotfiles folders), run `ansible-playbook main.yml --extra-vars=@/path/to/my/config.yml`

## Acknowledgements

This playbook is heavily inspired by
[Jeff Geerling's mac-dev-playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook).

The macOS settings (a.k.a. `defaults write`s) are mostly taken from
[Mathias Bynens' defaults scripts](https://mths.be/macos) or from one of the
dotfiles repos from [http://dotfiles.github.io](http://dotfiles.github.io).
